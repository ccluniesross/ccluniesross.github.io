          <h3>Pharrell, Pusha T Propel Creativity With Adidas and L.A. Kids</h3>
          <p><strong>August 10, 2015</strong></p>
           <img>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">The new superstars:</span>Rap music fired up more than 200 artists, athletes and students to get creative with Pharrell Williams and Adidas at Los Angeles' Milk Studio on Saturday night.</p>
            <p>Using the athletic company's Original Superstar sneaker as a canvas, guests dug into a tote bag of tools provided by Adidas, which wanted to see how the Millennials would reinvent its signature shell toe detail. Each unique design was then digitally printed onto an actual pair of shoes and projected as the backdrop for a surprise performance by rapper Pusha T, one of the five influencers hand-picked by the multifaceted Williams.</p>
            <p>"The goal was for Adidas to open up doors and provide a platform for young creative minds to, you know, bring their ideas into fruition and to see that it could be done," said Williams, who enjoys an ongoing collaboration with Adidas that lets him show not only his artistic side but also his progressive views on society and culture.</p>
            <p>"It's just a way to be with the culture, with the kids and with the people," Pusha T said. "We're pushing creativity, and getting to see the youth."</p>
            <p>The event embodied Adidas' fall campaign motif of creating for an audience of one, something exemplified by Williams' quintet of influencers. Besides Pusha T, he also selected actor and director Grigoriy Dobrygin, graffiti artist Smithe, visual artist VJ Mian and jewelry designer Yoon because, he said, they are “people who have great intentions to match their great creativity.”</p>
            <p>The campaign also gave Williams and Pusha T their first opportunity to work together outside of music. The duo will soon begin plugging Pusha T’s forthcoming album, titled “King Push.”</p>
            <p>“Between us, it’s a lot of black ambition and desire for black excellence,” Williams said. “We’re talking, essentially, human excellence.”</p>

          <h3>Anna Lunoe, Former Chanel DJ, Branches Out</h3>
          <p><strong>August 4, 2015</strong></p>
           <img>
            <p>It’s a searing hot day at the Pomona Fairplex, and Anna Lunoe arrives for her photo shoot wearing a plaid miniskirt, an oversize white T-shirt, round sunglasses and a studded choker. Her hair is wound up in two buns. It’s her signature look, one imitated by the throngs of fans huddled in the pit at her shows who sport the same Princess Lei do and wacky accessories.</p>
            <p>“I have literally worn a similar thing for years — either wear a miniskirt with a crop top or I wear a T-shirt. It’s about shapes that make you feel comfortable, then making it feel fun,” she explains.</p>
            <p>Fresh off of her tour with Jack Ü (Skrillex and Diplo’s band), Lunoe spent the weekend in the Southern California desert town playing the Hard Summer 2015 festival, where she stood out in the lineup of mostly male, black T-shirt-clad DJs.</p>
            <p>For the twentysomething Aussie, fashion is not only a form of expression — it was her entrée into the music world. Lunoe started out as a radio show host in her native Sydney, and first surfaced on the fashion scene as a DJ, spinning at soirées thrown by Chanel, Prada, Fendi and Louis Vuitton and later crafting tracks for their fashion shows. She says she produced those tunes based on each designer’s inspiration for the collection.</p>
            <p>“Designers have a really acute idea of whatever it is that they’re trying to do with their clothing, so they want music that really captures that essence in a modern way,” she says, “You want to take their inspiration and you want to move it forward.”</p>
            <p>Lunoe finds the risk-takers like Karl Lagerfeld and Miuccia Prada amongst the most inspiring. “People who take a gamble and commit to something are inspiring to me,” she says.</p>
            <p>Lunoe’s rise was swift after she moved to Los Angeles in 2012. She collaborated with Touch Sensitive on a single that year called “Real Talk,” and later released her EP “All Out,” which made it onto iTunes Top Five Dance chart.</p>
            <p>After that, it didn’t take her long to score invites to festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza and Hard Summer. She says that while fashion set her on the musical path, it’s no longer her creative muse. In other words, she’s over following trends and hopes to be setting some of her own.  “I more wear and represent what feel like cultural moments to me — expressing myself rather than taking it in.”</p>

          <h3>Los Angeles Scene: Bars, Restaurants, and More</h3>
          <p><strong>July 25, 2015</strong></p>
           <img>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Familia First:</span>Chef Ray Garcia continues to conquer downtown with his second Latin locale, <span class="bold">Broken Spanish</span>,which opened in June. More formal than B.S. Taqueria, Broken Spanish reflects Garcia’s warmth by creating a sense of family and community. Combining the diversity of Los Angeles with his Latin roots, the menu encourages family-style dining with mostly small plates such as sweet Mexican bread topped with foie gras butter and brown sugar ($13).</p>
            <p>Broken Spanish, 1050 South Flower Street</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Less is more:</span>Four years in Ho Chi Minh City gave chef Shawn Pham the culinary connection to his family’s culture that he was looking for. His one-month-old restaurant <span class="bold">Simbal</span> imparts the simplicity and balance that he observed in Vietnam into dishes like short rib potpie with lemongrass, annatto and bone marrow ($16). Said Pham, “From food to fashion to design to art, doing more with less has always fascinated me.”</p>
            <p>Simbal, 319 East 2nd Street, Suite 202</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Southern Comfort:</span>One thing remained the same for chef Nick Montgomery and restaurateur Ami Lurie in their move from the Asian flare of Momofuku to the southern style of <span class="bold">Osso</span>: fried chicken. The duo swapped mu shu pancakes for potato salad to create Osso, which opened in June as “a neighborhood joint serving simple food and drinks,” said Lurie.</p>
            <p>Osso, 901 East 1st Street</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Bratwurst and Brew:</span>Authentic Austrian cuisine arrived this month in the form of sausages and steins. Serving schnitzel on freshly baked bread and Nutella-filled croissants from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily, <span class="bold">BierBeisl Imbiss</span> captures the energy and lifestyle of the new emerging downtown L.A,” said owner/chef Bernhard Mairinger.</p>
            <p>BierBeisl Imbiss, 541 South Spring Street</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Nola in L.A.:</span>With a raw bar upstairs and a frozen daiquiri bar downstairs, <span class="bold">Preux and Proper</span> combines the vivacious vibe of New Orleans with Southern California freshness. The drinks pack a punch and the menu delivers California takes on NOLA classics, like smoked shrimp beignets ($10) and foie gras Po’Boys ($19). Born and raised in Louisiana, owner Joshua Kopel said the downtown spot he opened last December “has the same grit, heart and soul of my hometown.”</p>
            <p>Preux and Proper, 840 South Spring Street</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Holy Mackerel:</span>After descending a spiral staircase at <span class="bold">Mrs. Fish</span>, guests discover a 5,500-gallon chandelier — filled with fish. The suspended aquarium brightens the bar, inviting guests to unwind with craft cocktails, tasty small bites and live music. This combination fashions “an atmosphere for live-music enthusiasts and the local bar crowd alike,” said Joseph Ojeda, director of operations at Citrus Hospitality Management, which runs the eight-month-old establishment.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Fish, 448 South Hill Street</p>
            <p><span class="boldcaps">Triple 8 Play:</span>Succulent soup dumplings and steaming sake take over the old Trader Vic’s spot at L.A. Live. Unveiled in May by the owners of Wokcano and EMC Seafood, <span class="bold">Triple 8</span> is a Chinese bar and grill with classics like Kobe beef porridge ($22) and sparkling blueberry sake ($10).</p>
            <p>Triple 8, 800 West Olympic Boulevard, A-120</p>

          <h3>Lindsay Luv, Zobha Team Up for Activewear Collection</h3>
          <p><strong>July 20, 2015</strong></p>
           <img>
            <p>Lindsay Luv is jumping from the turntables to the L.A. fashion scene.</p>
            <p>The celebrity DJ’s move from New York to the active Southern California lifestyle in 2010 inspired her new capsule collection with Zobha. Launching this holiday as a reflection of Luv’s rocker style, the collection is a monochromatic canvas adorned by a pop of rose gold, her signature color that accents the headphones she always wears behind the decks. She incorporated her love of music by adding loops and pockets to the clothing, allowing for easy access to iPods and headphones. She aimed to create activewear that made women look slim and put together both during and after a workout.</p>
            <p>“The collection is feminine and strong,” Luv said, “for a badass girl who could rock it from a boxing gym to a hike to a lunch date.”</p>
            <p>Because it is a limited run, the nine-piece collection is about 20 percent more expensive than Zobha’s main line, with items retailing from $55 for mesh overlay sports bras to $180 for reversible jackets with rose gold zippers.</p>
            <p>Zobha is scheduling meetings with department and specialty stores, including Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and a soon-to-open fitness chain called Chelsea Collective, to find a retail home for the collection. It is also targeting high-end studios such as Equinox and SoulCycle.</p>
            <p>The clothes are made for women who go “from runway to gym,” said Jennifer Vathanadireg, director of marketing for City of Commerce, California-based FAM Brands, which acquired Zobha two years ago.</p>
            <p>Music gave Luv the opportunity to move into fashion. She met Vathanadireg through DJ-ing parties for premium denim brand Hudson Jeans and designer Robert Rodriguez. She first dabbled in design two years ago, when the rose gold-zippered motorcycle jacket she created for Andrew Marc sold out at Bloomingdale’s.</p>
            <p>“Basically [in] my entire DJ career, my clients have been fashion clients, which has opened a lot of doors for me,” Luv said. “This is just the beginning.”</p>

          <h3>In the Spotlight: Hiro Clark</h3>
          <p><strong>June 10, 2015</strong></p>
           <img>
            <p><span class="bold">Name</span>: Hiro Clark</p>
            <p><span class="bold">History</span>: For many, the beach is the ultimate symbol of Los Angeles life. So after moving to California from New York in 2012, Andy Salzer began selling his line of men’s T-shirts, Hiro Clark, on its sandy shores — literally — last September. But what struck him most about L.A. were the struggles, or “dark optimism,” of the otherwise sunny city, where, he said, “People are willing to do whatever it takes to make it.” This attitude presents itself in the line’s edgy graphics.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Niche</span>: The 100 percent cotton, classic-fit T-shirts are produced in limited runs of 12 for each design. Despite being an unofficial uniform in Los Angeles, Salzer feels there is something missing in the men’s category, and he hopes to make his mark in T-shirts before expanding into other areas.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Key Products</span>:Hiro Clark collaborated with artist Michael Bevilacqua and photographer John Arsenault to produce the graphic T-shirts. A more unexpected collaboration is Hiro Clark x Le Labo, a line of scented T-shirts based on the idea of lovers stealing each others’ T-shirts and perfume.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Price Points</span>: Range from $78 retail for a solid to $128 for a graphic shirt.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Major Moment</span>: Hiro Clark T-shirts will move from online into brick-and-mortar in July, but Salzer remains mum on which stores will carry the line.</p>
